# ALCZip: A Novel Compression Method Integrating Large Language Models

**ALCZip** is a novel compression method that integrates large language models (LLMs) with traditional compression techniques to improve the handling of semantically rich data. By leveraging the power of LLMs for semantic simplification and adaptive dictionary construction, **ALCZip** achieves superior compression ratios, especially for complex, nuanced datasets such as those found in natural language processing (NLP) and specialized domains.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive LLM Integration:** Combines the power of large language models with traditional compression methods like Huffman coding for improved efficiency.
- **Semantic Simplification:** Introduces semantic simplification in lossless text compression, the first of its kind, enabling better handling of complex data structures.
- **High Compression Ratios:** Achieves substantial data reduction while maintaining high-quality output, suitable for long-term storage and bandwidth optimization.
- **Adaptability:** Can be applied to diverse datasets, particularly those involving intricate structures or specialized terminology (e.g., legal, scientific documents).
- **Open-Source:** The code is open-source and available for further research and development.

## Installation

To use **ALCZip**, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qinq29105/ALCZip.git
cd ALCZip
